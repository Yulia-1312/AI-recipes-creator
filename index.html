            INSTRUCTIONS: Prepare the following, placing each in the same large
            bowl as you complete it: Peel, trim, and thinly slice 2 pounds
            carrots (about 5 cups). Dice 1 small yellow onion (about 1 cup).
            Mince 3 garlic cloves. Finely chop 2 to 4 fresh dill sprigs until
            you have 1 tablespoon, plus more for garnish if desired. Juice 1
            medium lemon until you have 2 tablespoons. Melt 3 tablespoons
            unsalted butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until melted.
            Add the carrot mixture, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 1/4
            teaspoon black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the
            vegetables are crisp-tender and the liquid released from the
            vegetables is mostly evaporated, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic
            and dill. Cook, stirring often until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 1
            (32-ounce) carton low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth. Cover and
            bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Simmer covered, stirring
            occasionally, until the carrots are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove
            from the heat, uncover, and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes.
            Working in batches, carefully transfer the soup to a blender and
            blend until completely smooth. (Alternatively, blend directly in the
            pot with an immersion blender, though the soup will not be as
            smooth.) Transfer back to the pot, add the lemon juice, and stir to
            combine. Reheat over medium heat if desired. Stir in 1/2 cup heavy
            cream if desired. Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with more fresh
            dill and black pepper.
